## Overview

Estates modding covers the creation and modification of estates in Europa Universalis V. Estates represent the major power groups within a country: Crown, Nobles, Clergy, Burghers, Peasants, and others. Estates are stored in `/Europa Universalis V/game/in_game/common/estates/` as `.txt` files.

## Estate Structure

```
estate_name = {
    color = estate_color                    # Color identifier for UI

    power_per_pop = 25                      # Power gained per pop
    tax_per_pop = 150                       # Tax income per pop

    rival = -0.01                           # Rivalry factor with other estates
    alliance = 0.01                         # Alliance factor with other estates

    revolt_court_language = court_language  # Language used in revolts

    # Character spawning rules
    characters_have_dynasty = always        # always, sometimes, never
    can_spawn_random_characters = yes
    can_generate_mercenary_leaders = yes
    use_diminutive = no

    bank = yes                              # Can loan money

    # Ruler estate specific
    ruler = yes
    priority_for_dynasty_head = yes

    # Satisfaction modifiers (multiplied by satisfaction - threshold)
    satisfaction = {
        counter_espionage = 0.2
        monthly_prestige = 0.2
    }

    # High power modifiers (when power > threshold)
    high_power = {
        nobles_estate_max_tax = -0.5
        levy_combat_efficiency_modifier = 1.0
    }

    # Low power modifiers (when power < threshold)
    low_power = {
        nobles_estate_max_tax = 0.5
    }

    # Power-based modifiers (scaled by power)
    power = {
        parliament_base_support = 0.5
        trade_income = 1.0
    }

    # Opinion calculations for diplomacy
    opinion = {
        add = {
            desc = "ESTATE_OPINION_BASE"
            value = "opinion(scope:target)"
            multiply = 0.05
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `color` | Color identifier for UI display |
| `power_per_pop` | Estate power gained per pop of this type |
| `tax_per_pop` | Tax income generated per pop |
| `rival` | Natural rivalry with other estates (negative = rivalry) |
| `alliance` | Natural alliance with other estates |
| `revolt_court_language` | Language rebels use: court_language, common_language, liturgical_language |
| `characters_have_dynasty` | always, sometimes, never |
| `can_generate_mercenary_leaders` | Whether estate can provide mercenary leaders |
| `bank` | Whether estate can provide loans |
| `ruler` | If true, this is the ruling estate (crown) |
| `use_diminutive` | Use diminutive names for characters |

## Modifier Blocks

### satisfaction

Modifiers scaled by `(satisfaction - LOW_SATISFACTION_THRESHOLD)`:

Applied when estate satisfaction is high, providing bonuses to country.

### high_power

Modifiers applied when `(relative_power - LOW_POWER_THRESHOLD) > 0`:

Applied when estate has excessive power relative to others.

### low_power

Modifiers applied when `(relative_power - LOW_POWER_THRESHOLD) < 0`:

Applied when estate is weak relative to others.

### power

Static modifiers scaled by estate power:

Applied proportionally to estate's absolute power level.

## Opinion Block

Calculates diplomatic opinion from this estate toward other countries:

```
opinion = {
    add = {
        desc = "DESCRIPTION_KEY"
        value = some_value
        multiply = 0.05
    }

    if = {
        limit = { condition }
        add = {
            desc = "CONDITIONAL_OPINION"
            value = 10
        }
    }
}
```

## Base Game Estates

- `crown_estate` - The ruling power
- `nobles_estate` - Aristocracy
- `clergy_estate` - Religious leaders
- `burghers_estate` - Merchant class
- `peasants_estate` - Common farmers
- `dhimmi_estate` - Protected religious minorities
- `tribes_estate` - Tribal peoples
- `cossacks_estate` - Cossack communities

## Example

```
my_custom_estate = {
    color = custom_estate_color
    power_per_pop = 5
    tax_per_pop = 50
    rival = -0.01
    alliance = 0.01

    revolt_court_language = common_language
    characters_have_dynasty = sometimes
    can_generate_mercenary_leaders = yes

    satisfaction = {
        global_unrest = -0.5
        research_speed_modifier = 0.1
    }

    high_power = {
        global_monthly_development_modifier = 0.1
        monthly_towards_innovative = societal_value_significant_monthly_move
    }

    low_power = {
        global_monthly_development_modifier = -0.1
    }

    opinion = {
        add = {
            desc = "ESTATE_OPINION_BASE"
            value = "opinion(scope:target)"
            multiply = 0.05
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Power and tax balance**: Balance `power_per_pop` and `tax_per_pop` to reflect estate economic/political strength
2. **Satisfaction modifiers**: Use `satisfaction` block for bonuses when estate is content (counter-espionage, prestige, etc.)
3. **High/low power**: Define `high_power` and `low_power` to create dynamic estate balance mechanics
4. **Rivalry and alliance**: Use `rival` and `alliance` to create natural tensions/coalitions between estates
5. **Character generation**: Set `characters_have_dynasty` based on estate social structure (nobles = always, burghers = sometimes)
6. **Revolt language**: Use `revolt_court_language`, `common_language`, or `liturgical_language` for appropriate cultural flavor
7. **Bank capability**: Grant `bank = yes` to wealthy estates (burghers, nobles) for loan mechanics
8. **Power-based modifiers**: Use `power` block for effects that scale linearly with estate strength (parliament support, trade income)
9. **Opinion calculations**: Use `opinion` block to influence diplomatic stance based on estate preferences
10. **Ruler estate**: Only set `ruler = yes` for crown estate to designate the ruling dynasty
