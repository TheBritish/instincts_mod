AUTO-GENERATED GAME DOCUMENTATION FILES
==============================================
Last Updated: January 5, 2026

These .log files are auto-generated by the EU5 game engine and contain
the AUTHORITATIVE and COMPLETE documentation for all game mechanics.

SOURCE LOCATION:
  C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis V\docs\

FILES INCLUDED:
  ✅ modifiers.log (139 KB) - Complete list of all 3000+ modifiers with categories
  ✅ effects.log (319 KB) - Complete list of all effects with parameters
  ✅ triggers.log (319 KB) - Complete list of all triggers with parameters
  ✅ on_actions.log (18 KB) - Complete list of all on_action hooks
  ✅ event_targets.log (38 KB) - Complete list of all event target types
  ✅ custom_localization.log (916 KB) - Complete custom localization reference

HOW TO REGENERATE:
  1. Launch Europa Universalis V (eu5.exe)
  2. The game automatically generates these files in the docs folder
  3. Copy them to this REFERENCE folder:
     
     PowerShell command:
     Copy-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis V\docs\*.log" `
               -Destination ".\\.github\REFERENCE\" -Force

  4. These files are updated with each game patch, so regenerate after updates

USAGE:
  - These files are the PRIMARY SOURCE for all game mechanics
  - When in doubt, ALWAYS check these files first
  - Wiki documentation is incomplete - these files are exhaustive
  - Use PowerShell Select-String for quick searches:
    
    Example: Find all wine-related modifiers
    Select-String -Path "modifiers.log" -Pattern "wine"
    
    Example: Find all building cap modifiers
    Select-String -Path "modifiers.log" -Pattern "cap_level"

ADVANTAGES OVER MANUAL DOCUMENTATION:
  ✅ Auto-generated = always accurate
  ✅ Complete = no missing mechanics
  ✅ Updated with game = stays current with patches
  ✅ Structured format = easy to parse programmatically
  ✅ Shows categories = understand which scopes modifiers apply to

INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING REFERENCE FILES:
  - EU5_MODIFIERS_REFERENCE.txt - Now includes complete list from modifiers.log
  - EU5_EFFECTS_REFERENCE.txt - Cross-reference with effects.log
  - EU5_TRIGGERS_REFERENCE.txt - Cross-reference with triggers.log
  - EU5_ON_ACTIONS_REFERENCE.txt - Cross-reference with on_actions.log

MODIFIER CATEGORIES (from modifiers.log):
  - Country: Affects entire country (most common for advances/laws/policies)
  - Location: Affects specific provinces/locations
  - Character: Affects character attributes
  - Unit: Affects military unit stats
  - None: Special/internal modifiers
  - All: Available in all contexts

FORMAT EXAMPLE (modifiers.log):
  Tag: global_wine_output_modifier, Categories: Country, , All,
  
  Meaning:
  - Modifier name: global_wine_output_modifier
  - Primary category: Country (use in country scope)
  - Applies to: All contexts

BEST PRACTICES:
  1. Search these log files BEFORE writing new code
  2. Verify modifier names exactly (case-sensitive)
  3. Check categories to ensure proper scope usage
  4. Regenerate after major game patches (1.x.0 releases)
  5. Use these to update manual reference files when patterns change
