# EU5 Goods Modding Reference

**Verified for**: EU5 version 1.0

## Overview

Goods modding covers the creation and modification of trade goods in Europa Universalis V. Goods are resources that are produced, traded, and consumed in the game economy. Goods are stored in `/Europa Universalis V/game/in_game/common/goods/` as `.txt` files organized by category.

## Goods Structure

```
goods_name = {
    method = farming                    # Production method
    category = raw_material             # Goods category

    color = goods_color                 # Color for UI display

    default_market_price = 3            # Base market price
    transport_cost = 2                  # Cost to transport

    base_production = 0.2               # Base production amount

    inflation = yes                     # Causes inflation (precious metals)

    ai_rgo_size_importance = 10         # AI preference for RGO expansion
    ai_rgo_expansion_priority = 0.2     # AI priority for expanding production

    development_threshold = 20          # Minimum development for demand

    # Pop demand additions
    demand_add = {
        nobles = 0.25
        burghers = 0.01
        clergy = 0.01
        all = 0.0004
    }

    # Pop demand multipliers
    demand_multiply = {
        upper = 2.5
        nobles = 1.5
    }

    # Wealth thresholds for consumption
    wealth_impact_threshold = {
        all = 1.05
        nobles = 1.5
    }

    custom_tags = { old_world_goods new_world_goods }
}
```

## Key Attributes

| Attribute | Description |

| `category` | Goods category: raw_material, plantation, produced, food |
| `color` | Color identifier for UI |
| `default_market_price` | Base price in markets |
| `transport_cost` | Cost added for transportation |
| `base_production` | Default production amount without buildings |
| `inflation` | If yes, producing this causes inflation (gold, silver) |
| `ai_rgo_size_importance` | AI preference to avoid building cities on this RGO |
| `ai_rgo_expansion_priority` | AI priority for expanding production |
| `development_threshold` | Minimum development for demand to exist |
| `demand_add` | Flat demand additions per pop type |
| `demand_multiply` | Demand multipliers per pop type |
| `wealth_impact_threshold` | Wealth level at which consumption changes |
| `custom_tags` | Tags for scripting: old_world_goods, new_world_goods |

## Production Methods

- `farming` - Agricultural production (horses, silk, wine)
- `mining` - Extracted from the ground (iron, gold, coal)
- `gathering` - Collected resources (salt, pearls, sand)
- `forestry` - Wood and forest products (lumber)
- `hunting` - Animal products (ivory)

## Goods Categories

- `raw_material` - Basic unprocessed resources
- `plantation` - Plantation crops (sugar, tobacco, cotton)
- `produced` - Manufactured goods
- `food` - Consumable food products

## Demand System

### demand_add

Flat demand additions per pop:

```
demand_add = {
    nobles = 0.25      # Nobles add 0.25 demand
    burghers = 0.01
    all = 0.0004       # All pops add this amount
}
```

### demand_multiply

Multipliers to base demand:

```
demand_multiply = {
    upper = 2.5        # Upper class multiplier
    nobles = 1.5       # Nobles-specific multiplier
}
```

### wealth_impact_threshold

Wealth level thresholds:

```
wealth_impact_threshold = {
    all = 1.05         # All pops: 105% wealth threshold
    nobles = 1.5       # Nobles: 150% wealth threshold
}
```

## Base Game Goods Categories

### Raw Materials

Iron, copper, tin, lead, coal, stone, sand, clay, lumber, horses

### Precious Goods

Gold, silver, gems, pearls, amber, marble

### Luxury Goods

Silk, dyes, incense, tea, coffee, cocoa, spices (pepper, cloves, saffron, chili)

### Agricultural

Wine, fiber crops, medicaments, salt, fruit

### Special

Elephants, ivory, saltpeter, alum, mercury

## Example

```
my_custom_goods = {
    method = farming
    category = raw_material
    color = goods_custom

    default_market_price = 4
    transport_cost = 1

    demand_add = {
        nobles = 0.1
        burghers = 0.05
        all = 0.001
    }

    demand_multiply = {
        upper = 2.0
    }

    wealth_impact_threshold = {
        all = 1.0
    }

    custom_tags = { old_world_goods }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Production method**: Match method to how the good is obtained (farming for crops, mining for metals, gathering for rare materials)
2. **Category**: Use appropriate category for economic simulation (raw_material vs produced affects trade dynamics)
3. **Market price**: Balance `default_market_price` and `transport_cost` to create realistic trade economics
4. **Demand system**: Use `demand_add` for baseline consumption and `demand_multiply` for luxury goods (high upper class consumption)
5. **Wealth thresholds**: Set `wealth_impact_threshold` higher for luxury goods (only consumed when pop wealth is high)
6. **AI priorities**: Use `ai_rgo_size_importance` and `ai_rgo_expansion_priority` to guide AI production decisions
7. **Development threshold**: Set `development_threshold` for luxury/advanced goods that require developed provinces
8. **Inflation**: Only use `inflation = yes` for precious metals (gold, silver) to simulate historical inflation
9. **Custom tags**: Use `custom_tags` for scripting support (e.g., `old_world_goods` vs `new_world_goods` for events/modifiers)
10. **Pop type demand**: Differentiate demand by pop type (nobles consume luxury goods, peasants consume basics)
