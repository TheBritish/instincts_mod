   max_levels = 5                  # Maximum building levels (can use script value)
   pop_type = laborers             # Pop type employed by building
   category = infrastructure_category    # Building category
   employment_size = generic_peasant_building_employment

   # Location type restrictions
   rural_settlement = yes
   town = yes
   city = yes

   location_potential = {
       # Triggers for where building can be built
       has_river = yes

## Production methods

Buildings can have production methods that consume and produce goods:

unique_production_methods = {
   stone_bricks = {
       stone = 0.4
       produced = masonry
       output = 0.5
       category = guild_input
   }

location_potential = {
   # Geographic
   has_river = yes

   # Topography
   topography = mountains
   topography = plateau
   topography = hills

   # Climate
   climate = mediterranean
   climate = continental

   # Vegetation

   vegetation = forest
   vegetation = jungle

   # Resources
   raw_material = goods:iron
   NOT = { raw_material = goods:stone }

   # Development

   }

   build_time = guild_build_time

   modifier = {
       local_production_efficiency = 0.1
       local_monthly_development_modifier = 0.02
   }

   unique_production_methods = {
       my_building_maintenance = {

## Key attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| color | Color identifier for UI display |
| editor | Weight for spawning in map editor |
| assimilation_conversion_factor | Speed of cultural/religious conversion |
| pop_food_consumption | Food consumed per pop unit |
| city_graphics | Contribution to city visual appearance |
| promotion_factor | Rate at which pops promote |
| migration_factor | Willingness to migrate |
| upper | If yes, considered upper class |
| has_cap | If yes, has a maximum population |
| grow | If yes, can grow naturally |
| tribal_rules | If yes, uses special tribal promotion |
| promote_to | Pop types this can promote to |
| counts_towards_market_language | Affects market language determination |

## Estate assignments

Pops can belong to different estates based on conditions:

# Default assignment (empty condition)
nobles_estate = {}

# Conditional assignment
dhimmi_estate = { is_dhimmi = yes }
tribes_estate = { is_gaelic_clans = yes }
cossacks_estate = { is_cossacks = yes }

## Impact modifiers

### literacy_impact

Modifiers scaled by literacy level:

literacy_impact = {
   local_cultural_tradition = 0.2
   local_monthly_control = 0.01
   local_production_efficiency = medium_production_efficiency_bonus
}

### pop_percentage_impact

Modifiers scaled by pop percentage:

pop_percentage_impact = {
   local_distance_from_capital_cost_modifier = 0.5
   local_unrest = 0.2
}

## Base game pop types

### Upper Class

`nobles` - Aristocracy, military leadership
`clergy` - Religious figures, scholars
`burghers` - Merchants, urban middle class

### Working Class

`laborers` - Urban workers, craftsmen
`soldiers` - Military personnel
`peasants` - Rural farmers (base pop type, promotes to others)

### Special

`tribesmen` - Tribal peoples (can promote to peasants)
`slaves` - Enslaved population

## Promotion chains

tribesmen -> peasants -> laborers/soldiers/burghers/clergy/nobles

## Example

my_custom_pop = {
   color = custom_pop_color
   editor = 0.2
   assimilation_conversion_factor = 0.2
   pop_food_consumption = 2.0
   city_graphics = 0.5

   # Belongs to burghers estate
   burghers_estate = {}
   promotion_factor = 0.3
   migration_factor = 0.2

   upper = no
   has_cap = yes
   grow = no

   promote_to = burghers

   literacy_impact = {
       local_production_efficiency = 0.1
       local_monthly_development_modifier = 0.05
   }
}
