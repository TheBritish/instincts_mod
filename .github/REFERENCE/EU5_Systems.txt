## Character interaction structure

An interaction defines conditions, costs, and effects:

interaction_name = {
   message = yes                   # Show notification
   is_consort_action = no          # Whether this affects consorts
   on_own_nation = yes             # Can be used within own nation

   price = price:interaction_price # Script value for cost

   price_modifier = {
       # Dynamic price adjustments
       add = 1
       if = {
           limit = { scope:recipient ?= { age_in_years > 40 } }
           subtract = {
               desc = "CHAR_AGE_LABEL"
               value = age_in_years
               subtract = 40
               multiply = 0.02
           }
       }
   }

   potential = {
       # Conditions for interaction to appear
   }

   allow = {
       # Conditions to enable interaction
       scope:actor = {
           has_heir = yes
       }
   }

   select_trigger = {
       # Target selection UI
       looking_for_a = character
       source = actor
       target_flag = recipient
       name = "choose_character"
       column = {
           data = name
       }
       visible = { trigger }
       enabled = { trigger }
   }

   effect = {
       # What happens when interaction is used
       scope:actor = {
           set_new_ruler = heir
       }
   }

   ai_tick = daily
   ai_tick_frequency = 120         # How often AI checks this

   ai_will_do = {
       # AI decision weight
       add = {
           desc = "REASON"
           value = some_value
       }
   }
}

## Key attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| message | Whether to show a notification message |
| is_consort_action | If true, interaction involves consorts |
| on_own_nation | If true, can only target own nation's characters |
| price | Cost to perform the interaction (uses price definition) |
| price_modifier | Dynamic modifications to the price |
| potential | Triggers for when interaction appears |
| allow | Triggers for when interaction can be used |
| effect | Effects executed when interaction is performed |
| ai_tick | How often AI evaluates: daily, monthly |
| ai_tick_frequency | Days between AI evaluations |
| ai_will_do | AI decision weight calculation |

## Select trigger

Used to let players choose character targets:

select_trigger = {
   looking_for_a = character
   source = actor
   target_flag = recipient
   name = "localization_key"
   column = {
       data = name
   }
   visible = {
       scope:actor = {
           ruler ?= root
       }
   }
   enabled = {
       is_adult = yes
   }
}

## Common character scopes

`scope:actor` - The country initiating the action
`scope:recipient` - The character being acted upon
`root` - The current character in iteration

## Example

grant_title = {
   message = yes
   on_own_nation = yes

   price = price:grant_title_price

   potential = {
       scope:actor = {
           government_type = government_type:monarchy
       }
   }

   allow = {
       scope:recipient = {
           is_adult = yes
           NOT = { has_title = yes }
       }
   }

   select_trigger = {
       looking_for_a = character
       source = actor
       target_flag = recipient
       name = "select_noble"
       column = {
           data = name
       }
       visible = {
           estate_type = estate_type:nobles_estate
       }
       enabled = {
           is_adult = yes
       }
   }

   effect = {
       scope:recipient = {
           add_character_modifier = {
               modifier = titled_noble
               years = -1
           }
       }
       scope:actor = {
           add_estate_satisfaction = {
               type = estate_type:nobles_estate
               value = 0.05
           }
       }
   }

   ai_tick = monthly
   ai_tick_frequency = 60

   ai_will_do = {
       add = 10
       multiply = {
           value = scope:recipient.total_abilities
           multiply = 0.01
       }
   }
}
