# EU5 International Organization Modding Reference

**Source:** https://eu5.paradoxwikis.com/International_organization_modding  
**Verified for:** EU5 version 1.0
**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025

## Overview

International organization modding covers the creation and modification of international organizations in Europa Universalis V. These include organizations like the Holy Roman Empire, coalitions, crusades, and defensive leagues.

International organizations are stored in `/Europa Universalis V/game/in_game/common/international_organizations/` as individual `.txt` files.

## Organization Structure

## Modifier Blocks

### modifier

Applied to **all member countries:**

```
modifier = {
    block_from_change_to_kingdom_rank = yes
    reject_subjugation_reasons = 25
}
```

### leader_modifier

Applied **only to the leading country:**

```
leader_modifier = {
    diplomatic_capacity = 1
    great_power_score_exempt_from_forfeit = 250
}
```

### international_organization_modifier

Applied **to the organization itself:**

```
international_organization_modifier = {
    hre_max_elector = 4
    hre_max_archbishop_elector = 3
}
```

## Variables

Organizations can track custom variables with monthly changes:

```
variables = {
    imperial_authority = {
        format = "IMPERIAL_AUTHORITY_DISPLAY"
        change_format = "VARIABLE_CHANGE_FORMAT"
        min = 0
        max = 100
        monthly_change = {
            add = {
                desc = "INTERNAL_PEACE"
                if = {
                    limit = {
                        international_organization_has_internal_peace = no
                    }
                    value = 0
                }
                else = {
                    value = 0.05
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Fields:**
- `format` - Localization key for display format
- `change_format` - Localization key for change format
- `min` - Minimum value
- `max` - Maximum value
- `monthly_change` - Script value for monthly change (supports conditionals)

## Special Statuses

Define special positions within the organization:

```
special_statuses_implemented = {
    emperor
    elector
    archbishop_elector
    free_city
}
```

These statuses can have associated privileges and powers defined elsewhere.

## War Mechanics

```
# Leader joining
only_leader_country_joins_defensive_wars = yes

# Military access
gives_military_access_to_all_when_at_war = yes

# Automatic war joining
join_defensive_wars_always = {
    is_subject_of = scope:target
}

join_defensive_wars_auto_call = {
    scope:target = { is_neighbor_of = root }
}

# War declaration control
can_declare_war = {
    NOT = { is_target_of_international_organization = scope:target }
}
```

## Membership Triggers

```
# Visibility
create_visible_trigger = {
    has_dlc = "Conquest of Paradise"
}

invite_visible_trigger = {
    is_neighbor_of_international_organization = scope:recipient
}

# Eligibility
can_lead_trigger = {
    government_rank = 3
}

can_join_trigger = {
    religion = scope:recipient.GetStateReligion
}

can_leave_trigger = {
    NOT = { is_leader_of_international_organization = scope:recipient }
}

# Automatic actions
auto_leave_trigger = {
    NOT = { religion = scope:recipient.GetStateReligion }
}

auto_disband_trigger = {
    num_of_members < 3
}

# Parliament voting
can_vote_in_parliament = {
    has_special_status_in_international_organization = {
        international_organization = scope:recipient
        status = elector
    }
}
```

## Effects

```
on_joined = {
    add_prestige = 10
    add_opinion = {
        target = scope:international_organization.leader
        modifier = joined_organization
    }
}

on_left = {
    add_prestige = -5
}

monthly_effect = {
    if = {
        limit = { is_leader_of_international_organization = scope:recipient }
        add_diplomatic_reputation = 0.01
    }
}
```

## AI Decision Making

```
ai_desire_to_join = {
    add = {
        desc = "BASE_VALUE"
        value = 10
    }
    
    multiply = {
        desc = "THREATENED"
        if = {
            limit = {
                any_neighbor_country = { is_threat_to = root }
            }
            value = 2.0
        }
    }
}

ai_desire_to_allow_new_member = {
    add = 50
    
    subtract = {
        desc = "RIVAL"
        if = {
            limit = { is_rival_of = scope:actor }
            value = 100
        }
    }
}

ai_issue_voting_bias = {
    # Script value for parliament voting behavior
}
```

## Base Game Organizations

- `hre` - Holy Roman Empire
- `catholic_church` - Catholic Church
- `coalition` - Anti-aggressor coalitions
- `crusade` - Religious crusades
- `defensive_league` - Defensive alliances
- `independence_movement` - Independence wars

## Example: Custom League

```
my_custom_league = {
    has_target = no
    unique = no
    
    has_leader_country = yes
    leader_title_key = "LEAGUE_LEADER"
    leader_type = country
    leader_change_method = vote
    disband_if_no_leader = yes
    
    modifier = {
        defensive_war_morale = 0.1
    }
    
    leader_modifier = {
        diplomatic_reputation = 1
    }
    
    can_join_trigger = {
        is_neighbor_of_international_organization = scope:recipient
    }
    
    can_leave_trigger = {
        NOT = { is_leader_of_international_organization = scope:recipient }
    }
    
    on_joined = {
        add_prestige = 5
    }
    
    ai_desire_to_join = {
        add = {
            desc = "THREATENED"
            if = {
                limit = {
                    any_neighbor_country = { is_threat_to = root }
                }
                value = 50
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Unique vs multiple instances** - Use `unique = yes` for singular orgs (HRE), `no` for repeatable (defensive leagues)
2. **Leader type consistency** - Match `leader_type` to organization purpose (character for dynasties, country for alliances)
3. **Disband conditions** - Set `disband_if_no_leader` based on org stability (yes for player-created, no for historical)
4. **Modifier separation** - Use distinct modifier blocks for members, leaders, and organization itself
5. **Variable tracking** - Track organization health metrics with variables (authority, cohesion, etc.)
6. **War mechanics** - Configure war joining carefully to avoid cascade effects
7. **Auto leave triggers** - Implement for religion/government changes that violate org rules
8. **Parliament voting** - Restrict voting to special statuses for realistic governance
9. **AI desire weighting** - Use descriptive `desc` keys for AI decision transparency
10. **Land ownership rules** - Use modifiers to penalize internal aggression

## Localization

```yaml
<organization_name>: "Organization Name"
<organization_name>_desc: "Organization description"
<leader_title_key>: "Emperor"  # or whatever leader title
```

## IO Events

International Organization events should be **regular events**, not Dynamic Historical Events (DHE).

**❌ WRONG - Do not use DHE for IO events:**
```
io_events.1 = {
    type = country_event
    dynamic_historical_event = {
        tag = HSA  # Only fires for HSA, not other members
        # ...
    }
}
```

**✅ CORRECT - Use regular events:**
```
io_events.1 = {
    type = country_event
    fire_only_once = yes
    
    trigger = {
        is_member_of_international_organization = international_organization:io_name
        # Other conditions...
    }
    
    # Event content...
}
```

**Key Points:**
- IO events fire for **any current member** when trigger conditions are met
- Use `is_member_of_international_organization = international_organization:<io_key>` in triggers
- Late-joining members can still experience events (unlike DHE which are tag-restricted)
- No special `category = io_event` needed (base game IO events don't use categories)
- Examples: HRE events, Jurchen Confederation events, Colonial Federation events
