# EU5 Concept Modding Reference

**Source:** https://eu5.paradoxwikis.com/Concept_modding  
**Verified for:** EU5 version 1.0

## Overview

Concept modding involves the creation of new game concepts to be usable in Europa Universalis V. Game concepts are tooltip-enabled terms that appear in localization text with special formatting and help documentation.

Game concepts are located in `common/game_concepts`, usually in the `main_menu` top folder.

## Basic Syntax

```
concept_key = {
    alias = { alias_key_1 alias_key_2 }
    texture = "gfx/interface/icons/path/to/icon.dds"
}
```

**Example:**

```
reformation = {
    alias = { protestant protestants }
    texture = "gfx/interface/icons/situations/reformation.dds"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `concept_key` - The name of the game concept (localization key base)
- `alias` - Alternative keys that reference the same concept
- `texture` - Icon texture path (no implicit assignment, must be specified)

## Family and Parent

Game concepts can be organized hierarchically:

```
my_concept = {
    family = parent_concept      # Shows parent in tooltip
    parent = parent_concept_2    # Unused, but accessible via GUI
    texture = "..."
}
```

- `family` - The concept's family parent (shown in tooltip)
- `parent` - Parent concept (unused, but accessible via `GameConceptTooltip.GetParentText` in GUI)

## Europedia and Loading Screen

Control where concepts appear:

```
my_concept = {
    shown_in_encyclopedia = no       # Default: yes
    shown_in_loading_screen = yes    # Default: no
    texture = "..."
}
```

- `shown_in_encyclopedia` - Whether concept appears in Europedia (default: `yes`)
- `shown_in_loading_screen` - Whether concept appears in loading screens (default: `no`)

## Map Mode

Override the current map mode when hovering the concept:

```
my_concept = {
    tooltip_map_mode = trade_power_map_mode
    texture = "..."
}
```

- `tooltip_map_mode` - Map mode to display (keys from `gfx/map/map_modes/`)

## Localization

**Required localization keys:**

```yaml
game_concept_<key>: "Concept Title"
game_concept_<key>_desc: "Concept description"
```

**Alias localization:**

```yaml
game_concept_<alias_key>: "Alias Title"
```

- Aliases use the main concept's description
- No separate description needed for aliases

**Usage in localization:**

- `[concept_key]` - Plain text with tooltip
- `[concept_key|e]` - Colored text (concept light blue) with tooltip

**Example:**

```yaml
game_concept_reformation: "Reformation"
game_concept_reformation_desc: "The Protestant Reformation was a movement..."
game_concept_protestant: "Protestant"
game_concept_protestants: "Protestants"
```

In event text:
```
"The [reformation|e] has begun! [protestant|e] movements are spreading."
```

## GUI Datacontext Usage

**Global promote:**

```
GC( Arg0 )
```
- `Arg0`: Game concept key
- Returns: Tooltip for the concept

**Custom concept tooltip:**

```
Concept( Arg0, Arg1 )
```
- `Arg0`: Concept key
- `Arg1`: Text to display (different from expected alias)

**Conditional concept selection:**

```
SelectGameConcept( Arg0, Arg1, Arg2 )
```
- `Arg0`: Conditional statement
- `Arg1`: Concept key if true
- `Arg2`: Concept key if false

## Example: Trade Concept

```
trade = {
    alias = { merchant merchants trade_route trade_routes }
    texture = "gfx/interface/icons/concepts/trade.dds"
    shown_in_encyclopedia = yes
    family = economy
}
```

**Localization:**

```yaml
game_concept_trade: "Trade"
game_concept_trade_desc: "Trade represents the exchange of goods..."
game_concept_merchant: "Merchant"
game_concept_merchants: "Merchants"
game_concept_trade_route: "Trade Route"
game_concept_trade_routes: "Trade Routes"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always specify texture** - No implicit icon assignment; define path for every concept
2. **Use meaningful aliases** - Create plural forms and common variations
3. **Organize with families** - Group related concepts under parent families
4. **Europedia control** - Hide implementation-detail concepts with `shown_in_encyclopedia = no`
5. **Use |e formatting** - Apply `[concept|e]` for colored concept text in events/tooltips
6. **Map mode integration** - Use `tooltip_map_mode` for map-related concepts (trade, religion, culture)
7. **Complete localization** - Provide both title and description for main concepts
8. **Alias efficiency** - Reuse main concept's description for aliases
9. **Consistent naming** - Use clear, descriptive keys for concepts
10. **GUI integration** - Leverage `GC()` and related functions in custom GUI elements
