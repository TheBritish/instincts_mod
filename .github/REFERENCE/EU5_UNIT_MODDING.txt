# EU5 Unit Modding Reference

**Verified for**: EU5 version 1.0

## Overview

Units modding covers the creation and modification of military units in Europa Universalis V. Units are the combat forces that make up armies and navies. Unit types are stored in `/Europa Universalis V/game/in_game/common/unit_types/` as `.txt` files organized by age and type.

## Unit Type Structure

```
unit_type_name = {
    category = army_infantry            # Unit category
    buildable = yes                     # Can be recruited

    age = "age_3_discovery"             # Age availability

    max_strength = 0.4                  # Maximum regiment strength
    combat_power = 1                    # Base combat power

    # Terrain impact modifiers (movement)
    impact = {
        jungle = 0.10
        wetlands = 0.10
        mountains = 0.10
    }

    # Terrain combat modifiers
    combat = {
        jungle = -0.10
        wetlands = -0.10
        mountains = -0.10
    }

    # Artillery specific
    bombard_efficiency = 0.15           # Siege effectiveness
    artillery_barrage = 4               # Barrage power

    # Costs
    maintenance_demand = early_infantry_maintenance
    construction_demand = early_infantry_construction
}
```

## Key Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `category` | Unit category (see below) |
| `buildable` | If yes, can be recruited by players |
| `age` | Age when unit becomes available |
| `max_strength` | Maximum regiment strength value |
| `combat_power` | Base combat power multiplier |
| `impact` | Movement speed modifiers by terrain |
| `combat` | Combat effectiveness modifiers by terrain |
| `bombard_efficiency` | Siege effectiveness (artillery) |
| `artillery_barrage` | Artillery barrage power |
| `maintenance_demand` | Monthly maintenance cost script value |
| `construction_demand` | Recruitment cost script value |

## Unit Categories

### Land units

- `army_infantry` - Infantry regiments
- `army_cavalry` - Cavalry regiments
- `army_artillery` - Artillery regiments
- `army_auxiliary` - Supply units

### Naval units

- `navy_heavy_ship` - Ships of the line
- `navy_light_ship` - Trade/patrol ships
- `navy_transport` - Troop transports
- `navy_galley` - Galley ships

## Ages

Unit availability by age:

- `age_1_traditions` - Medieval units
- `age_2_renaissance` - Renaissance units
- `age_3_discovery` - Early gunpowder units
- `age_4_reformation` - Mid-game units
- `age_5_absolutism` - Line infantry era
- `age_6_revolutions` - Late game units

## Terrain Modifiers

### impact

Affects movement speed:

```
impact = {
    jungle = 0.10       # +10% movement cost in jungle
    wetlands = 0.10
    mountains = 0.10
    hills = 0.05
    forest = 0.05
}
```

### combat

Affects combat effectiveness:

```
combat = {
    jungle = -0.10      # -10% combat power in jungle
    wetlands = -0.10
    mountains = -0.10
    plains = 0.10       # +10% combat power in plains
}
```

## Template Units

Template units (buildable = no) define base stats that other units inherit:

```
a_age_3_discovery_infantry = {
    category = army_infantry
    buildable = no              # Template only
    max_strength = 0.4
    combat_power = 1
    age = "age_3_discovery"
}
```

## Base Game Unit Progression

### Infantry strength progression

| Age | Max Strength | Combat Power |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Traditions | 0.1 | 1 |
| Renaissance | 0.2 | 1 |
| Discovery | 0.4 | 1 |
| Reformation | 0.8 | 1.5 |
| Absolutism | 1.6 | 2.25 |
| Revolutions | 3.2 | 3 |

### Artillery progression

| Age | Max Strength | Combat Power | Bombard Efficiency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Traditions | 0.01 | 2 | 0.1 |
| Renaissance | 0.05 | 3 | 0.125 |
| Discovery | 0.1 | 4 | 0.15 |
| Reformation | 0.3 | 5 | 0.20 |
| Absolutism | 0.6 | 6 | 0.25 |
| Revolutions | 1.2 | 8 | 0.25 |

## Example

```
my_custom_unit = {
    category = army_infantry
    buildable = yes

    age = "age_4_reformation"

    max_strength = 1.0
    combat_power = 1.75

    impact = {
        mountains = 0.05        # Better in mountains than average
        jungle = 0.15
    }

    combat = {
        mountains = 0.10        # Combat bonus in mountains
        jungle = -0.05
        plains = -0.05          # Penalty in open terrain
    }

    maintenance_demand = custom_infantry_maintenance
    construction_demand = custom_infantry_construction
}
```

## Unique Units

Countries can have unique units unlocked through advances:

```
english_longbowmen = {
    category = army_infantry
    buildable = yes
    age = "age_2_renaissance"

    max_strength = 0.25
    combat_power = 1.5

    # Special bonuses for this unit
    combat = {
        plains = 0.15
        farmland = 0.15
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Age progression**: Follow vanilla progression curves for `max_strength` and `combat_power` to maintain game balance
2. **Template units**: Use `buildable = no` for template units that define base stats for inherited units
3. **Terrain modifiers**: Balance `impact` (movement penalty) and `combat` (combat effectiveness) for unit specialization
4. **Artillery**: Use `bombard_efficiency` and `artillery_barrage` for artillery units; these don't apply to other unit types
5. **Costs**: Reference script values for `maintenance_demand` and `construction_demand` for dynamic cost scaling
6. **Age gating**: Set appropriate `age` to control when units become available (earlier ages = weaker units)
7. **Unique units**: Create country-specific units with unique terrain bonuses for historical flavor
8. **Combat power scaling**: Each age roughly doubles max_strength and increases combat_power gradually (see progression tables)
9. **Terrain specialization**: Use positive `combat` modifiers for unit strengths (e.g., cavalry in plains) and negative for weaknesses (infantry in mountains)
10. **Unlock via advances**: Link unique units to advances using `unlock_unit` attribute in advance definitions
