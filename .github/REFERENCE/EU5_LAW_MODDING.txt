**Verified for**: EU5 version 1.0

## Overview

Laws are policies that countries can adopt, providing various modifiers and affecting gameplay in Europa Universalis V. Laws are stored in `/Europa Universalis V/game/in_game/common/laws/` as `.txt` files organized by government type and category.

## Law Structure

```
law_group_name = {
    law_category = administrative       # Law category for UI
    law_gov_group = monarchy            # Government type restriction

    potential = {
        # Conditions for law group to appear
        government_type = government_type:monarchy
    }

    # Law options
    option_name = {
        unique = yes                    # Only one country can have this

        potential = {
            # When this option appears
            tag = XXX
        }

        allow = {
            # Conditions to select this option
            current_age = age_5_absolutism
        }

        country_modifier = {
            # Modifiers applied when selected
            monthly_legitimacy = 0.05
            stability_investment = small_stability_investment
        }

        estate_preferences = {
            # Which estates prefer this option
            clergy_estate
            nobles_estate
        }

        years = 2                   # Cooldown before changing
    }
}
```

## Example

```
my_custom_law = {
    law_category = administrative
    law_gov_group = monarchy

    potential = {
        government_type = government_type:monarchy
    }

    traditional_approach = {
        country_modifier = {
            stability_cost = -0.1
            monthly_towards_traditionalist = societal_value_monthly_move
        }
        estate_preferences = {
            clergy_estate
            nobles_estate
        }
        years = 2
    }

    progressive_approach = {
        country_modifier = {
            research_speed_modifier = 0.1
            monthly_towards_innovative = societal_value_monthly_move
        }
        allow = {
            current_age = age_3_discovery
        }
        estate_preferences = {
            burghers_estate
        }
        years = 2
    }

    unique_country_approach = {
        unique = yes
        potential = {
            tag = ENG
        }
        country_modifier = {
            diplomatic_reputation = 1
            global_monthly_development_modifier = 0.05
        }
        estate_preferences = {
            crown_estate
        }
        years = 2
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Law categories**: Match law groups to appropriate categories for UI organization
2. **Government restrictions**: Use `law_gov_group` to ensure laws only appear for appropriate government types
3. **Unique options**: Use `unique = yes` for country-specific options (combined with `tag` in `potential`)
4. **Estate balance**: Consider estate satisfaction when setting `estate_preferences` - laws favored by powerful estates may be easier to pass
5. **Cooldown periods**: Use `years` to prevent frequent law changes (typical range: 2-5 years)
6. **Allow conditions**: Use `allow` for age/tech/resource requirements (e.g., `current_age = age_3_discovery`)
7. **Societal values**: Laws can push countries toward societal values using modifiers like `monthly_towards_traditionalist` or `monthly_towards_innovative`
